      <h2>Early life and education</h2>
      <p>
        Shweta Rathore studied bio-chemical engineering at Manipur University.
        Shweta is an engineer by qualification and was working in a corporate
        scenario for many years in marketing. Since her school days, she was
        very much driven by fitness because she had a slightly broad frame. In
        India, not many people understand the difference between being large
        frame and being fat, and thatâ€™s why people started calling her fat. This
        thing hit her because she was a very active child and use to take part
        in cultural activities and sports at her school. Shweta started proper
        gyming when she was in 8th standard and from there onwards, it
        continues, and fitness became her lifestyle. She was very much driven
        into fitness so one day, her brother suggested Shweta to try it
        professionally, and that's how she came into fitness.[
